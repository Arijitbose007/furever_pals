Navbar.jsx:

1)Added props to receive the state (isMenuOpen, toggleMenu, isSupportMenuOpen, toggleSupportMenu) from the parent component.
2)Updated the button click handler for the menu toggle (toggleMenu) to use the function passed as a prop (toggleMenu) instead of directly updating the state.
3)Updated the button click handler for the support menu toggle (toggleSupportMenu) to use the function passed as a prop (toggleSupportMenu) instead of directly updating the state.
4)Updated the conditional rendering of the menu to use the isMenuOpen state received as a prop.
Home.jsx:

1)Imported and rendered the Navbar component, passing down the necessary props (isMenuOpen, toggleMenu, isSupportMenuOpen, toggleSupportMenu) to manage the menu state.
2)Ensured that the content section is conditionally hidden based on the isMenuOpen state.
